# Enigma
Functionality 4 <br>
-Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. <br> -Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented <br>

Object Oriented Programming 4 <br>
-Project includes a module and/or superclass that could be used outside of the Enigma project. <br>
-all classes are less than 100 lines <br>
-At least one class demonstrates a good use of class methods. <br>
-Variable and method names always clearly communicate purpose. <br>
-all lines of code are less than 80 characters <br>
-All methods are less than 8 lines of code <br>

Test Driven Development<br>
3: Meets Expectations <br>
-All test names clearly communicate the purpose of the test. <br>
-At least one test implements mocks and stubs. <br>
-Test coverage metrics show 100% coverage for Enigma, Decrypt, Encrypt classes. <br>
-While I don't think my commit history demonstrates it, I did improve my TDD practices in this project!
