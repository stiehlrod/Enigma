# Enigma#decrypt(ciphertext, key, date)
# The decrypt method takes a ciphertext String and the Key used for encryption as arguments. The decrypt method can optionally take a date as the third argument. If no date is given, this method should use todayâ€™s date for decryption.
#
# The decrypt method returns a hash with three keys:
#
# :decryption => the decrypted String
# :key => the key used for decryption as a String
# :date => the date used for decryption as a String in the form DDMMYY
